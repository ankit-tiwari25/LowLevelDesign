Single Responsibility Principle

A class should only have one responsibility.

Issue : Invoice class has multiple responsibilities like, save to DB, printInvoice.

In future there can be multiple new requirements like save to mongoDB, etc.

It's better to have a single responsibilty of a class, method or a block of code.
